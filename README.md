# Rock Paper Scissors RPG

## 📝 Description

This is a website that turns the classic game of Rock Paper into a Japanese RPG-style game. The game itself is themed after Final Fantasy 7. The game has the user to go through rounds of opponents with more and more health. How far a player gets is tracked by the game. The main technologies used to build this were: Node Package Manager, Sass, Javascript, HTML, and Webpack.

## 📋 Requirements

- Node.js LTS v20.11.1+
- Node Version Manager

## 🌱 Context

This is was my final project for my first term at Turing School. All code was created by myself. This took place during week 6 of a 24 week program. It took ~35 hours to complete this project from planning to the final commit as of 03/06/23.

## 🏆 Wins and Challenges

### Wins

- Being able to add extra styling elements to the project. At the start of this project, I felt that CSS was one of my weaker points. Being able to style the whole project to feel more Final Fantasy themed was something I'm proud of!
- Getting better at using webpack and setting it up. I want to continue practice using webpack in my future projects and continue improving using it.

### Challenges

- After completing the project one of the feedbacks given to me was to work on communicating. I over engineered parts of the program that didn't need to be as complicated and should have used Functional Programming over Object Oriented Programming. Had I spoken to my project manager more often, I would have been able to communicate what I was doing and understand what the project needed.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

- Add settings that you can change
- Add a story mode
- Abilities that you can gain as you level
- Mobile friendly layout
- Refactor the code from a OOP to FP design paradigm
